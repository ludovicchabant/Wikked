The search box available on the sidebar is the quickest way to get around your
wiki. 

When you start typing something in it, it will search for that in
real-time in all the wiki's pages' titles, showing you those pages' titles
in a constantly updated drop-down list. You can use the arrow keys to select an
entry, and the `Enter` or `Return` key to go to it.

If none of the pages in the drop-down list look like what you're searching for, 
you can press `Enter` or `Return` and get taken to the full list of search
results.

Please note that search has the following limitations:

- Only the "raw text" of pages is indexed -- that's the text that's stored in
  the page files, and the text that you see when you edit a page. This means
  that any content brought into a page via queries, includes, and other such
  "dynamic" features, _will not_ be searchable.

- Search results are filtered based on the read permissions of the currently
  logged-in user (or the anonymous user if nobody's logged in). If you search
  for something contained in a page you don't have permission to read, that page
  won't show up in the results.
