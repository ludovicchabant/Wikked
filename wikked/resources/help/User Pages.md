When you are logged in, a link in the sidebar (see [[Navigating]]) will let you
access your "_user page_".

A user page is a page in the `user` endpoint whose name is your username. It is
not private by default, but it's easy to make it so by specifying permissions
like so: `{% raw %}{{readers: <username>}}{% endraw %}` (where `<username>` is
your username). See [[Configuration]] for more information.
