Wikked's purpose is to be easy to browse and edit -- like a web-based notebook.

To help with the "browsing" part, Wikked offers:

- Easily spotted links in the page's text. 
- A sidebar where you can quickly use the main features of your wiki, or search
  for pages.


## Links

Links from a page are (with the default theme) shown in an easily spottable
bright blue. You can learn about creating links on the [[Editing Pages]] and
[[Linking]] help.

Links that point to a page that doesn't exist yet will be shown in red. If you
click on one of them, you'll be given the opportunity to create the missing page
by simply writing its initial contents. For example, here's a link to 
[[:/A Missing Page]] (assuming you haven't created a page by this name already!).

Last, _external_ links, _i.e._ links that point to a page that doesn't belong to
your wiki, will be shown with a little arrow next to the link. For example, here
is a link to the [official Wikked website][1].


## Sidebar

The Wikked sidebar contains various entries depending on the currently displayed
page, whether a user is logged in, and what permissions that user has. However,
here is a list of items you would typically see:

- **Home**: a quick way to get back to the main page of your wiki. That's
  generally a page named `Main Page` but it could be different (see
  [[Configuration]]).

- **New Page**: creates a brand new page. See [[Creating Pages]].

- **Edit**: edits the currently displayed page. See [[Editing Pages]].

- **History**: shows the history of the currently displayed page. See
  [[History]].

- **Search box**: lets you search for content in your wiki. See [[Searching]].

- **Pages linking here**: shows a list of pages that link to the current page.

- **Upload file**: lets you upload a file (such as an image) for you to use in
  a page. See [[Editing Pages]].

- **Special pages**: opens a dashboard that links to a variety of informational,
  administrative, or troubleshooting pages. See [[Special Pages]].

- **Login/logout**: logs in or out of the wiki.

- **Your user page**: when logged in, this leads you to your personal page. See
  [[User Pages]].
